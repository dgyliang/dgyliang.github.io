                                    I am David Liang, and I write this sob story in hopes to gain favor with employers and admissions offices (LOL). I was born in GuangZhou, China on October 7th, 1999. 
                                    I currently live in California, and just graduated with a Psychology and Cognitive Schience degree at UCSD. <br><br>
                                    I was born into a loving family that includes two hard-working parents, and a very smart and funny older brother. However, before my developing mind was 
                                    able to even fathom the existence of my father, he immigrated to the United States in Janurary 2000 in search of better opportunities. This left my mother alone to take care of both
                                    me and my brother. Eventually in 2008, My family was able to join my father in the States.Despite being in America for almost 10 years, my dad did not know how to speak English, 
                                    and you've probably heard it all before - both of my parents ended up working low-paying laborous jobs in order to put food
                                    on the table. Being a child of strict Chinese parents, I also felt the same kind of pressure my parents felt. I was constantly reminded of how inadequate I am at school, being bullied
                                    almost everyday. I was also reminded of the financial hardships of the family every night at the dinner table, with my dad constantly scolding me to get good grades and get into a good
                                    college so we wouldn't have to live in my aunt's garage anymore. It was thanks to all those hardships that I was able to overcome adversity and become who I am today.

                            One of my favorite ways to pass time is to watch watch anime and korean dramas. I basically grew up on anime, so I've watched all kinds of things - from Miyazaki's classic Ghibli movies, mecha animes such
                            as Gundam and Evangelion, to newer popular seasonal series such as (enter meta anime series here). I love reading all kinds of manga as well, such as Berserk and romantic comedies like Kaguya-sama: Love Is War.
                            I also watch Korean dramas sometimes as well. By the way, please don't hesitate if you want to recommend me any animes, manga titles, or dramas.

                    <h1>Food and Cooking</h1>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        In China, there is one homogenous culture ‚Äì that of the Han people. Everyone practically eats the same thing, regardless of the province one hails from. 
                        Rice, noodles and stir-fry are the staples of our diet. When I emigrated to this country, I finally discovered what it meant to be in a so-called ‚Äúmelting pot.‚Äù America is a mixture of different cultures, customs and ethnicities. 
                        People from even the farthest flung reaches of this earth flock here in search of new opportunities in hopes of achieving the ‚ÄúAmerican dream.‚Äù This caused a boon for the variety of food on offer. 
                        Think hole-in-the-wall Mediterranean foods like kebabs, or nondescript Indian grocers selling the most exotic of spices sourced straight from the Asian subcontinent. 
                        And let‚Äôs not even get started on the seemingly endless varieties of dim sum at any given local Chinatown establishment. The very nature of this environment has allowed me to explore and develop a new hobby ‚Äì cooking. 
                        In my spare time, I have taken cooking classes online as an expression of creativity. I love handcrafting the rice that goes into a good piece of nigiri sushi, and I also love the thrill of walking along the many isles of fresh produce in a farmers market. 
                        Even the simple act of sharing food amongst close relatives is exciting to me. To the Japanese, the preparation of food can be summed up as an art form. Likewise, the French emphasis on fresh cooking takes you back to a bygone era when traditional open-air markets reigned king. 
                        For Asian cultures like mine, there is no a la carte. Food is typically served in a communal setting and shared among family members. The dishes are divvied up as chopsticks clatter. 
                        I absolutely love observing how different cultures prepare their food and I always try to learn their style, which is why I love cooking.

                        This probably comes as no surprise, but like many other teenagers and young adults, I love to game. One of my first games I've ever played was a massive multiplayer online role playing game 
                        called Maplestory. Then, I've played games like Runescape, Gunbound, GunZ, and everyone's favorite - Minecraft. Nowadays I don't have much time playing games, but I do try to play them when I have the chance.
