                                    Hi, I am David Liang. I was born in GuanZhou China on October 7th, 1999, and currently live in California, studying at UCSD with a major in Psychology. <br>
                                    I was born into this world into a loving family that includes two wonderful and hard-working parents, and a very smart and funny older brother. However, before my developing mind was 
                                    able to even fathom the existence of my father, he immigrated to the United States in Janurary 2001 in search of better opportunities. This left my mother alone to take care of both
                                    me and my brother, working day and night in order to single handedly support the two good-for-nothing boys at home. Eventually in 2008, My family was able to join my father in the States.
                                    Despite being in America for almost 10 years, my dad did not know how to speak English, and you've probably heard it all before - both of my parents ended up working hard, low-paying laborous jobs in order to put food
                                    on the table. Being a child of strict Chinese parents, I also felt the same kind of pressure my parents felt. I was constantly reminded of how inadequate I am at school, being bullied
                                    almost everyday. I was also reminded of the financial hardships of the family every night at the dinner table, with my dad constantly scolding me to get good grades and get into a good
                                    college so we don't have to live in a garage anymore. Fast forward ten years, I was able to get into one of my dream schools: University of California, San Diego. Needless to say, 
                                    it was thanks to all those hardships that I was able to overcome adversity.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    On days where I am not being a depressed Asian son, I like to play video games, build computers, and cook. My hobby of cooking most likely stemmed from the fact that I had to creatively
                                    make up dishes from random ingredients in the pantry when my parents are working overtime at work everyday. After years of experimenting and eating potentially dangerously mixed foods,
                                    I found a passion to actually create edible and even tasty dishes.
