                <h2>Hey There!!</h2>
                <p>
                    I see you have stumbled upon this humble little online portfolio! You are probably either an employer who found this site through my resume, or a friend of mine who is thinking of using the 
                    embarrassing picture of me on the left as blackmail. Either way, you came to the right place! <br>
                    If you are an employer, thank you for taking the time to check this portfolio out! This is just a little side project that I made to help people learn more about me. Through this portfolio,
                    you will be able to find all of my prior work experience, extracurricular activities, and anything else that I may have otherwise be unable to fit onto a dinky little piece of paper that is my resume.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You will be able to navigate through the portfolio through the naviation links at the top, and my contact information is located at the bottom of every page.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Again, thanks for coming!
                </p>
