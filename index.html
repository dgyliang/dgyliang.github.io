                        I see you have stumbled upon this humble little online portfolio! You are probably either an employer who found this site through my resume, or a "friend"ðŸ¤¡ of mine who thinks it's comedy gold to use this 
                        to make fun of me and blackmail me for food. Either way, welcome!<br><br>
                        If you are an employer, thank you for taking the time to check this portfolio out! This is a little side project of mine to learn web-design, and help people learn more about me. Through this portfolio,
                        you will be able to find all of my prior work experience, hobbies, and anything else that I may have been unable to fit onto a dinky little one-page resume. I don't have a background in computer science or design,
                        and I learned most of what I know alone, so I hope this website isn't ugly enough to make your eyes burn off.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You will be able to navigate through the portfolio with the naviation links on the left, and my contact information is located there as well.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Again, thanks for coming!
