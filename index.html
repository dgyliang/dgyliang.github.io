                <p>
                    I see you have stumbled upon this humble little online portfolio! You are probably either an employer who found this site through my resume, or a friend of mine who is thinking of using this 
                    to make fun of me and blackmail me for food. Either way, Welcome!<br>
                    If you are an employer, thank you for taking the time to check this portfolio out! This is a little side project of mine to learn web-design, and help people learn more about me. Through this portfolio,
                    you will be able to find all of my prior work experience, extracurricular activities, and anything else that I may have otherwise be unable to fit onto a dinky little piece of paper that is my resume.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You will be able to navigate through the portfolio through the naviation links at the top, and my contact information is located at the bottom of every page.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Again, thanks for coming!'
