                        A simple bot built for the popular messaging app Discord. I have actually built an personal updated version of this bot and use it in my own servers. You will be able to find more information
                        on said bot under the "Hobby Projects" section below.

                        Final Project for UCSD's COGS 108 course, an upper division practical data science course. <br><br>
                        This project uses python statistical libraries to perform statistical analysis to examine several potential mediating factors in predicting obesity rates in U.S states, including family income, fastfood restaurant accessibility,
                        and education level. Regression models were used to analyze relationships of these factors, and geospatial maps were created for visualization of data. <br>
                        We found that household income has the strongest correlation to obesity rate per capita, however the study itself is heavily flawed, in part due to our limitation of access to updated census data, as well
                        as the nature of the study being strictly correlational, with no account for possible extraneous factors. <br><br>
                        The Github repository is unfortunately private, to protect the confidentiality of my project partners.

                        This web portfolio is made from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Java Script; the site is hosted on Github Pages. I am by no means an expert, and it took me just about a whole winter break to learn the basics of 
                        everything that is needed to build this portfolio. That's right, before making this site, I had absolutely zero experience with HTML, CSS, or Java Script! In fact, I had only taken 
                        introduction classes to python and C++. <br><br>

                        Bossu bot is a bot made for a popular messaging app, Discord. The bot is built in discord.py, and is hosted on Heroku. It is based off of a simple discord bot that I built for my
                        COGS 18 final project. This is mainly a fun little personal bot that I use for my personal use, as well as a fun little side hobby of mine as a way to learn how to code.
                        I have learned many new concepts while working on Bossu bot, such as web-scraping and very specialized python libraries. Thus, this bot will constantly 
                        receive new and experimental features. Some features include a built in chat bot that uses AIML based off of A.L.I.C.E Bot, and uses web-scraping to dynamically search for answers it 
                        does not know how to answer. It also has other web-scraping commands to look up player stats for certain games... and much more! Try this bot out by inviting it to your own
                        servers by clicking the invite link below( Warning: Since this is a highly personalized bot made for personal servers with close friends, the bot's language and demeanor can be
                        offensive.)  <br><br>

                        As an intern at UCSD's acclaimed eating disorder clinic, I am currently writing Python scripts for data cleaning and organization for the clinic's ongoing study on implicit and explicit learning
                        among patients with eating disorders. This is currently ongoing.
                        <br><br> This work contains sensitive patient data at the UCSD Eating Disorder Clinc, therefore as of now, the progress of my work remains confidential.
