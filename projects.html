                        A simple bot built for the popular messaging app Discord. I have actually built an personal updated version of this bot and use it in my own servers. You will be able to find more information
                        on said bot under the "Hobby Projects" section below.

                        This web portfolio is made from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Java Script; the site is hosted on Github Pages. I am by no means an expert, and it took me just about a whole winter break to learn the basics of 
                        everything that is needed to build this portfolio. That's right, before making this site, I had absolutely zero experience with HTML, CSS, or Java Script! In fact, I had only taken 
                        introduction classes to python and C++. <br><br>

                        Bossu bot is a bot made for a popular messaging app, Discord. The bot is built in discord.py, and is hosted on Heroku. It is based off of a simple discord bot that I built for my
                        COGS 18 final project. This is mainly a fun little personal bot that I use for my personal use, as well as a fun little side hobby of mine as a way to learn how to code.
                        I have learned many new concepts while working on Bossu bot, such as web-scraping and very specialized python libraries. Thus, this bot will constantly 
                        receive new and experimental features. Some features include a built in chat bot that uses AIML based off of A.L.I.C.E Bot, and uses web-scraping to dynamically search for answers it 
                        does not know how to answer. It also has other web-scraping commands to look up player stats for certain games... and much more! Try this bot out by inviting it to your own
                        servers by clicking the invite link below( Warning: Since this is a highly personalized bot made for personal servers with close friends, the bot's language and demeanor can be
                        offensive.)  <br><br>
