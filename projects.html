                    <p>
                        Our goal was to find a formula and model that best classified cases of heart disease. We performed forward stepwise selection and k-fold cross validation to determine the best formula as well as the best threshold choice for 
                        our logistic regression model. Through this, we achieved a mean test accuracy of 0.848, and mean training accuracy of 0.860. Unofrtunately the notebook for this project is private due to the wishes of my groupmates.

                    <p>
                        Final Project for UCSD's COGS 108 course, an upper division practical data science course. <br><br>
                        This project uses python statistical libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, etc to perform analysis on several potential mediating factors in predicting obesity rates in U.S states, including family income, fastfood restaurant accessibility,
                        and education level. Regression models were used to analyze relationships of these factors, and geospatial maps were created for visualization of data. <br>
                        We found that household income has the strongest correlation to obesity rate per capita, however the study itself is heavily flawed, in part due to our limitation of access to updated census data, as well
                        as the nature of the study being strictly correlational, with no account for possible extraneous factors. <br><br>
                        The Github repository is unfortunately private, due to their wishes to remain anonymous.

                        Bossu bot is a bot made for a popular messaging app, Discord. The bot is built in discord.py, and is hosted on Heroku. It is based off of a simple discord bot that I built for my
                        COGS 18 final project. This is mainly a fun little personal bot that I use for my personal use, as well as a fun little side hobby of mine as a way to learn how to code.
                        I have learned many new concepts while working on Bossu bot, such as web-scraping and very specialized python libraries. Thus, this bot will constantly 
                        receive new and experimental features. Some features include a built in chat bot that uses AIML based off of A.L.I.C.E Bot, and uses web-scraping to dynamically search for answers it 
                        does not know how to answer. It also has other web-scraping commands to look up player stats for certain games... and much more! Try this bot out by inviting it to your own
                        servers by clicking the invite link below( Warning: Since this is a highly personalized bot made for personal servers with close friends, the bot's language and demeanor can be
                        offensive.)  <br><br>
